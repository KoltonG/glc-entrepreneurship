        #Materials + Special Requirements

        * Learners will need an email address to sign in to Glitch.
        * Anchor chart paper + markers are needed for brainstorming (or post-it notes and a flat surface).

        <br>
        #Contingency

        If you do not have access to the internet, this content can be run offline, in pairs. Steps:

        * Ensure that [Atom](http://atom.io) is installed on all of the computers.
        * Pair up learners with one laptop per pair. Review the Pair Programming information with the class (linked to the setup slide).
        * Ensure that the starter code is copied onto all of the computers. ('offline-starter-code' folder)
        * If your know ahead of time that you will be working offline, move the **Offline Option** notes (bottom of applicable slides) to the top so that learners can follow along more easily. You can also scroll down to these instructions if you prefer leaving the slides as-is.
        * Please remind learners to save often! They will need to save, then refresh the website in their browser to see changes.
        * While learners are preparing for their demo presentations, collect their projects on a USB - or have learners bring their computers to the front to plug into the projector.

        #Notes

        **Introductions (Slide 3):**
        Ask learners to put their computers into "politeness mode" (closed halfway) before you begin.

        Have mentors stand up and introduce themselves.

        Have learners introduce themselves to their table groups and answer an icebreaker question, e.g. "If you could travel anywhere in the world, where would you want to go?"

        **Coders' Code (slide 5):**

        1. Ask for help: If you’re stuck or having trouble with something, work with the person beside you, or put up your hand to ask the instructor or one of our mentors for help.
        1. Be present: We really want you to learn a lot in this workshop, so make sure to pay attention and follow along with the activities.
        1. Try your best: Even the best coders have trouble sometimes, so we don’t expect you to do everything perfectly the first time, but make sure you’re trying your best. Don’t be afraid to try things out and make mistakes!

        **Code is.. (slide 7):**
        Optional: Facilitate this [Do the Robot activity](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tUTiHl7scs8RHdLLvdmZTFtD9EuAyZhetTLFgvar5CQ/edit#heading=h.bnz2ltopi57a).

        **What are some qualities of an entrepreneur? (slide 9):**
        If an entrepreneur is someone who is starting a new business, what are some skills they should have? What characteristics should someone have if they are starting a new business?

        **Examples (slide 14-15):**
        Here are some examples of entrepreneurs in and outside of our Canada Learning Code community!

        *Note: Learn more about the Young Hunters program [here](https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2014/09/02/young-hunters-nunavut_n_5652698.html).*

        Q: What does 'currency' mean? (money!) - Cryptocurrencies are like digital money.

        Q: What problems were these entrepreneurs trying to solve?

        **Your Turn! (slide 16):**
        Have learners pair up at their table groups. Ideally, two parent-child pairs should team up together. If any parents/guardians came with more than one child, you can have more than two learners on a team.

        **Calling for Brainstorms (slide 17):**
        Have teams write and draw ideas out on a piece of anchor chart paper - all writing ideas at the same time (like a mind map). Have them consider these questions as they brainstorm.

        Use a timer to keep teams on track. E.g. [timer-tab.com](http://timer-tab.com).

        When teams are ready they can start making connections and circle their final idea.

        **Calling for Brainstorms (slide 18):**
        These are some ideas for the few groups that might be having trouble thinking of something.

        **Share your ideas with the group (slide 20):**
        Go around the room and have each team share their startup idea with the class.

        **Tags to Remember (slide 31):**
        These are the basic elements (or parts) of a website.

        `<html>` tells the browser which language we are communicating in.
        `<head>` is where we put the behind-the-scenes information that we need to know, but don't need everyone else to see (like thoughts in our head!).
        `<body>` is where all of our content goes, what people see when they visit our website. This is where we will be working today.

        **Tags to Remember (slide 32)**
        `<title>` is the name of the website (what is saved when you bookmark a website).
        `<h1>` is a heading (or title that we actually see on the webpage).
        `<p>` is a paragraph of text.

        **Create an account (slide 34):**
        An email address is required for this step. Have parents/guardians help with this step.

        In the case where participants don't have an email address and aren't comfortable creating one, Glitch will save a cached version of their website in their browser, but only temporarily. They will not be able to save or view their website later unless they create an account and log in.

        **Collaborating in Glitch (slide 36):**
        In order to find the website and request to join, type in `glitch.com/~` and add the name of the project on the end of the url. **Don't forget the `~` tilde!

        This link will take us to the project page on Glitch. In order to preview the website and share it with others, use the public URL instead (same as the Preview Live link): `name-of-website.glitch.me`

        Learners may need to refresh their page once they have been invited to join by their partner.

        **Say 'Hello' to your team (slide 37):**
        You'll notice that Glitch works like Google Docs! All collaborators can edit at the same time, and see changes as they are made.

        **Setting up Glitch (slide 38):**
        This is optional, but will make the learners' lives easier as they develop their websites. It removes the step of having to click between tabs and scroll within their code editor.

        **STEP 1: Fill in your website's information (slide 39):**
        Show learners where each of these elements are in an example glitch project. Use the same project to demonstrate each STEP in the slides.

        **STEP 2: Add an image (slide 40):**
        Q: What does 'creative commons' mean?

        A: All of the pictures you see online belong to someone. When we use other people's pictures without their permission we are stealing their work. Creative commons means that the person who owns the image is okay with anyone using it. They still ask that we say where we got the image from, so be sure to save the name of the person who owns it, or a link to where you found it, and add this to your website.

        **Part 2 (slide 41):**
        If someone is using a screen reader to read our website, adding an alt attribute will read the description of what the image looks like to the user, so they don't miss out on anything on the website.

        **STEP 3: Build your website (slide 42):**
        Some groups may need some extra help sharing ideas and tasks as they work on the same page. Encourage pairs to choose different sections to work on, and to discuss any design decisions before making them on their own.

        If learners have questions about how to add something (like sound), encourage them to search for keywords in the HTML reference linked (e.g. the word 'audio'). Finding out where to find answers to problems is so much more valuable than an instructor or mentor quickly giving them the solution.

        **What's the difference? (slide 46):**
        This is the exact same website - one with css and one without.

        **CSS (slide 51) - If humans were elements..:**
        Have everyone follow these pseudo code 'rules' as if they were CSS elements. This helps demonstrate that we can apply styles to all elements or specific ones.

        **Endless Style (slide 53):**
        Have learners open this website in a new tab. Demonstrate how to click (to auto-copy) then paste using the keyboard shortcut `ctrl + V`. You may need to write this shortcut on a whiteboard to remind learners.

        **Stretch goals (slide 58-59):**
        If you have time.

        **DEMOS (slide 60-61):**
        Give teams some time to prepare and practice their presentation (or 'pitch', like in Dragons Den).

        Ensure that every team has time to come to the front and present their startup idea + website. You'll need to ask for their URL (`name-of-website.glitch.me`) to type it into your computer.
