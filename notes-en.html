        <br>
        #Contingency

        If you do not have access to the internet, this content can be run offline, in pairs. Steps:

        * Ensure that [Atom](http://atom.io) is installed on all of the computers.
        * Pair up learners with one laptop per pair. Review the Pair Programming information with the class (linked to the setup slide).
        * Ensure that the starter code is copied onto all of the computers. ('offline-starter-code' folder)
        * If your know ahead of time that you will be working offline, move the **Offline Option** notes (bottom of applicable slides) to the top so that learners can follow along more easily. You can also scroll down to these instructions if you prefer leaving the slides as-is.
        * Please remind learners to save often!
        * While learners are preparing for their demo presentations, collect their projects on a USB - or have learners bring their computers to the front to plug into the projector.

        #Opening Script

        Welcome to our Girls Learning Code Day workshop: Intro to Entrepreneurship &amp; Webmaking! We’re so glad that you could be here today and hope you’re ready to learn lots of new things.

        How many of you have been to one of our workshops or camps before?
        (If you get some hands up, ask a few of them what workshops they attended)

        We started running our first programs for kids with Girls Learning Code workshops and camps back in 2012, and then since we had so many people asking if boys could come too we started Kids Learning Code a year later in 2013. Since then, we’ve expanded to over 30 cities across Canada!

        Before we get started with our workshop, there are a few things we need to go over:

        * <strong>Washrooms:</strong> Can everyone please point in the direction of the washrooms? (clarify where they are located) If you need to go to the washroom, please bring let your parent/guardian know.
        * <strong>Water:</strong> If you brought a water bottle with you, you’re welcome to keep it on your desk, but make sure to keep the lid closed when you’re not using it.
        * <strong>Break/snacks:</strong> We’ll have a break when you can eat any snacks you brought with you or just stretch your legs. If you have a (peanut free) snack, please eat it out front and clean up any crumbs or wrappers when you’re done.

        <br>
        #Notes:

        **Introductions (Slide 3):**
        Ask learners to put their computers into "politeness mode" (closed halfway) before you begin.

        Have mentors stand up and introduce themselves.

        Have learners introduce themselves to their table groups and answer an icebreaker question, e.g. "If you could travel anywhere in the world, where would you want to go?"

        **Coders' Code (slide 5):**

        1. Ask for help: If you’re stuck or having trouble with something, work with the person beside you, or put up your hand to ask the instructor or one of our mentors for help.
        1. Be present: We really want you to learn a lot in this workshop, so make sure to pay attention and follow along with the activities.
        1. Try your best: Even the best coders have trouble sometimes, so we don’t expect you to do everything perfectly the first time, but make sure you’re trying your best. Don’t be afraid to try things out and make mistakes!

        **Code is.. (slide 7):**
        Optional: Facilitate this [Do the Robot activity](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tUTiHl7scs8RHdLLvdmZTFtD9EuAyZhetTLFgvar5CQ/edit#heading=h.bnz2ltopi57a).

        **What are some qualities of an entrepreneur? (slide 9):**
        If an entrepreneur is someone who is starting a new business, what are some skills they should have? What characteristics should someone have if they are starting a new business?

        **Examples (slide 14):**
        Here are some examples of entrepreneurs in our Canada Learning Code community!

        Q: What does 'currency' mean? (money!) - Cryptocurrencies are like digital money.

        Q: What problems were these two entrepreneurs trying to solve?

        **Your Turn! (slide 15):**
        Have learners pair up at their table groups. Ideally, two parent-child pairs should team up together. If any parents/guardians came with more than one child, you can have more than two learners on a team.

        **Calling for Brainstorms (slide 16):**
        Have teams write and draw ideas out on a piece of anchor chart paper - all writing ideas at the same time (like a mind map). Have them consider these questions as they brainstorm.

        Use a timer to keep teams on track. E.g. [timer-tab.com](http://timer-tab.com).

        When teams are ready they can start making connections and circle their final idea.

        **Calling for Brainstorms (slide 17):**
        These are some ideas for the few groups that might be having trouble thinking of something.

        **Share your ideas with the group (slide 19):**
        Go around the room and have each team share their startup idea with the class.

        **Tags to Remember (slide 30):**
        These are the basic elements (or parts) of a website.

        `<html>` tells the browser which language we are communicating in.
        `<head>` is where we put the behind-the-scenes information that we need to know, but don't need everyone else to see (like thoughts in our head!).
        `<body>` is where all of our content goes, what people see when they visit our website. This is where we will be working today.

        **Tags to Remember (slide 31)**
        `<title>` is the name of the website (what is saved when you bookmark a website).
        `<h1>` is a heading (or title that we actually see on the webpage).
        `<p>` is a paragraph of text.

        **Create an account (slide 33):**
        An email address is required for this step. Have parents/guardians help with this step.

        In the case where participants don't have an email address and aren't comfortable creating one, Glitch will save a cached version of their website in their browser, but only temporarily. They will not be able to save or view their website later unless they create an account and log in.

        **Collaborating in Glitch (slide 35):**
        In order to find the website and request to join, type in `glitch.com/~` and add the name of the project on the end of the url. **Don't forget the `~` tilde!

        This link will take us to the project page on Glitch. In order to preview the website and share it with others, use the public URL instead (same as the Preview Live link): `name-of-website.glitch.me`

        Learners may need to refresh their page once they have been invited to join by their partner.

        **Say 'Hello' to your team (slide 36):**
        You'll notice that Glitch works like Google Docs! All collaborators can edit at the same time, and see changes as they are made.

        **Setting up Glitch (slide 37):**
        This is optional, but will make the learners' lives easier as they develop their websites. It removes the step of having to click between tabs and scroll within their code editor.

        **STEP 1: Fill in your website's information (slide 38):**
        Show learners where each of these elements are in an example glitch project. Use the same project to demonstrate each STEP in the slides.

        **STEP 2: Add an image (slide 39):**
        Q: What does 'creative commons' mean?

        A: All of the pictures you see online belong to someone. When we use other people's pictures without their permission we are stealing their work. Creative commons means that the person who owns the image is okay with anyone using it. They still ask that we say where we got the image from, so be sure to save the name of the person who owns it, or a link to where you found it, and add this to your website.

        **Part 2 (slide 40):**
        If someone is using a screen reader to read our website, adding an alt attribute will read the description of what the image looks like to the user, so they don't miss out on anything on the website.

        **STEP 3: Build your website (slide 41):**
        Some groups may need some extra help sharing ideas and tasks as they work on the same page. Encourage pairs to choose different sections to work on, and to discuss any design decisions before making them on their own.

        If learners have questions about how to add something (like sound), encourage them to search for keywords in the HTML reference linked (e.g. the word 'audio'). Finding out where to find answers to problems is so much more valuable than an instructor or mentor quickly giving them the solution.

        **What's the difference? (slide 45):**
        This is the exact same website - one with css and one without.

        **CSS (slide 50) - If humans were elements..:**
        Have everyone follow these pseudo code 'rules' as if they were CSS elements. This helps demonstrate that we can apply styles to all elements or specific ones.

        **Endless Style (slide 52):**
        Have learners open this website in a new tab. Demonstrate how to click (to auto-copy) then paste using the keyboard shortcut `ctrl + V`. You may need to write this shortcut on a whiteboard to remind learners.

        **Stretch goals (slide 57-58):**
        If you have time.

        **DEMOS (slide 59-60):**
        Give teams some time to prepare and practice their presentation (or 'pitch', like in Dragons Den).

        Ensure that every team has time to come to the front and present their startup idea + website. You'll need to ask for their URL (`name-of-website.glitch.me`) to type it into your computer.

        #Closing Script

        Who can tell me something new they learned today? (<strong>*Refer to final slide for examples</strong>. If you don’t get any hands up, you can either ask a specific kid that was definitely engaged during the workshop, or review a couple of the key lessons in the workshop)

        You all did an amazing job and we’re really impressed with how great your projects turned out.

        If you want to learn more about coding, design, and technology, go onto our site girlslearningcode.com to check out all of our upcoming workshops and join our mailing list. (Announce next workshop and give short description).

        Before we go, let’s give our mentors a big hand!

        Thanks and we hope to see you all in another workshop soon!
