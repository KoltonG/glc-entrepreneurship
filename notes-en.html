        #Materials + Special Requirements

        * Learners will need an email address to save
        * Anchor chart paper + markers are needed for brainstorming

        <br>
        #Contingency

        If you do not have access to the internet, this content can be run offline, in pairs. Steps:

        * Ensure that Atom is installed on all of the computers.
        * Pair up learners with one laptop per pair. Review the Pair Programming information with the class (linked to the setup slide).
        * Ensure that the starter code is copied onto all of the learners computers. ('offline-starter-code' folder)
        * If your know ahead of time that you will be working offline, move the **Offline Option** notes (bottom of applicable slides) to the top so that learners can follow along more easily. You can also scroll down to these instructions if you prefer leaving the slides as-is.
        * Please remind learners to save often!
        * While learners are preparing for their demo presentations, collect their projects on a USB - or have learners bring their computers to the front to plug into the projector.

        <br>
        #Notes:

        **Introductions (Slide 3)**
        Ask learners to put their computers into "politeness mode" (closed halfway) before you begin.

        Have mentors stand up and introduce themselves.

        Have learners introduce themselves to their table groups and answer an iceabreaker question, e.g. "If you could travel anywhere in the world, where would you want to go?"

        **Coders' Code (slide 5)**

        1. Ask for help: If you’re stuck or having trouble with something, work with the person beside you, or put up your hand to ask the instructor or one of our mentors for help.
        1. Be present: We really want you to learn a lot in this workshop, so make sure to pay attention and follow along with the activities.
        1. Try your best: Even the best coders have trouble sometimes, so we don’t expect you to do everything perfectly the first time, but make sure you’re trying your best. Don’t be afraid to try things out and make mistakes!

        **Code is.. (slide 7)**
        Optional: Facilitate this [Do the Robot activity](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tUTiHl7scs8RHdLLvdmZTFtD9EuAyZhetTLFgvar5CQ/edit#heading=h.bnz2ltopi57a).

        **What are some qualities of an entrepreneur? (slide 9)**
        If an entrepreneur is someone who is starting a new business, what are some skills they should have? What characteristics should someone have if they are starting a new business?

        **Examples (slide 14)**
        Here are some examples of entrepreneurs in our Canada Learning Code community!

        Q: What does 'currency' mean? (money!) - Cryptocurrencies are like digital money.

        Q: What problems were these two entrepreneurs trying to solve?

        **Your Turn! (slide 15)**
        Have learers pair up at their table groups. Ideally, two parent-child pairs should team up together. If any parents/guardians came with more than one child, you can have more than two learners on a team.

        **Calling for Brainstorms (slide 16)**
        Have teams write and draw ideas out on a piece of anchor chart paper - all writing ideas at the same time (like a mind map). Have them consider these questions as they brainstorm.

        Use a timer to keep teams on track. E.g. [timer-tab.com](http://timer-tab.com).

        When teams are ready they can start making connections and circle their final idea.

        **Calling for Brainstorms (slide 17)**
        These are some ideas for the few groups that might be having trouble thinking of something.

        **Share your ideas with the group (slide 19)**
        Go around the room and have each team share their startup idea with the class.

        #Opening and Closing

        ##Kick-Off Script

        Welcome to our Girls Learning Code Day workshop: Intro to Entrepreneurship &amp; Webmaking! We’re so glad that you could be here today and hope you’re ready to learn lots of new things.

        How many of you have been to one of our workshops or camps before?
        (If you get some hands up, ask a few of them what workshops they attended)

        We started running our first programs for kids with Girls Learning Code workshops and camps back in 2012, and then since we had so many people asking if boys could come too we started Kids Learning Code a year later in 2013. Since then, we’ve expanded to over 30 cities across Canada!

        Before we get started with our workshop, there are a few things we need to go over:

        * <strong>Washrooms:</strong> Can everyone please point in the direction of the washrooms? (clarify where they are located) If you need to go to the washroom, please bring let your parent/guardian know.
        * <strong>Water:</strong> If you brought a water bottle with you, you’re welcome to keep it on your desk, but make sure to keep the lid closed when you’re not using it.
        * <strong>Break/snacks:</strong> We’ll have a break when you can eat any snacks you brought with you or just stretch your legs. If you have a (peanut free) snack, please eat it out front and clean up any crumbs or wrappers when you’re done.

        <br>
        ##Closing Script

        Who can tell me something new they learned today? (<strong>*Refer to final slide for examples</strong>. If you don’t get any hands up, you can either ask a specific kid that was definitely engaged during the workshop, or review a couple of the key lessons in the workshop)

        You all did an amazing job and we’re really impressed with how great your projects turned out.

        If you want to learn more about coding, design, and technology, go onto our site girlslearningcode.com to check out all of our upcoming workshops and join our mailing list. (Announce next workshop and give short description).

        Before we go, let’s give our mentors a big hand!

        Thanks and we hope to see you all in another workshop soon!
